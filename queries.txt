Simple queries:

 1.		select the total number of SYNSETs
 2.		select the total number of LITERALs
 3.		select the total number of ILRs (relations)
 4.		select the number of distinct LITERALs
 5.		select the number of distinct ILR TYPEs
 6.		select the number of SENSEs for each LITERAL having at least two SENSEs
 7.		select the number of ILRs for each SYNSET having at least two ILRs
 8.		select the number of ILRs for SYNSET with given ID value
 9.		select the number of ILRs including SYNSET with given ID value
		(In other words the query requires to find all ILRs referring to the SYNSET with given ID)
10.		select the number of LITERALs for each SYNSET having at least two LITERALs
11.		select the number of hypernyms for SYNSETs having at least two hypernyms
		(In other words the query requires to find all SYNSETs having at least two ILRs with the 'hypernym' ILR TYPE)
12.		select the number of SYNSETs containing at least one LITERAL belonging to set X
13.		select the number of LITERALs for SYNSET with given ID value
14.		select the number of ILRs for SYNSETs containing LITERALs starting with prefix X

Note 1: Queries 1-3 can be performed with the use of COUNT clause available in SQL and XPath.
Note 2: Queries 4-7, 10, 11 require XPath to perform two queries, due to the lack of support for DISTINCT and GROUP BY clauses.
Note 3: IDs in queries 8, 9, 13 were selected at random. The set of literals X in query 12 was selected at random. 
		The prefix X in query 14 was selected at random.

Complex queries:

 1.		select maximum hypernym-path length
		(The query requires to identify all bottommost SYNSETs, i.e. SYNSETs without hyponyms. 
		 Then it requires to follow the ILR paths from each of these SYNSETs to their topmost SYNSETs, 
		 i.e. SYNSETs without hypernyms. Finally, the maximum length of such path needs to be found.)
		 
 2.		select SYNSET having the fewest hyponym-paths
		(The query requires to identify all topmost SYNSETs, i.e. SYNSETs without hypernyms. 
		 Then it requires to follow the ILR paths from each of these SYNSETs to their bottommost SYNSETs, 
		 i.e. SYNSETs without hyponyms. Finally, the SYNSET having the minimum number of such path needs to be found.)
		 
 3.		select synset having the most hyponym-paths
		(The query requires to identify all topmost SYNSETs, i.e. SYNSETs without hypernyms. 
		 Then it requires to follow the ILR paths from each of these SYNSETs to their bottommost SYNSETs, 
		 i.e. SYNSETs without hyponyms. Finally, the SYNSET having the maximum number of such path needs to be found.)
		 
 4.		select synset having the fewest hypernym-paths
		(The query requires to identify all bottommost SYNSETs, i.e. SYNSETs without hyponyms. 
		 Then it requires to follow the ILR paths from each of these SYNSETs to their topmost SYNSETs, 
		 i.e. SYNSETs without hypernyms. Finally, the SYNSET having the minimum number of such path needs to be found.)
		 
 5.		select synset having the most hypernym-paths
		(The query requires to identify all bottommost SYNSETs, i.e. SYNSETs without hyponyms. 
		 Then it requires to follow the ILR paths from each of these SYNSETs to their topmost SYNSETs, 
		 i.e. SYNSETs without hypernyms. Finally, the SYNSET having the maximum number of such path needs to be found.)
